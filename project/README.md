My Wikies is a website that makes easy for you to share content between friends.

So if you have some annotations about math, lets say, you just need to create a wiki, post data on this wiki and share this with your friend.
It's possible to share the same wiki with any number of friends (the friends must be registered on the website),
as well as, create any number of wikies you like.

On the main page you have the option to create a wiki, where the new content can be stored, and requests to see if you were invited to be a part
of a new wiki.

By clicking on the tile of the wiki you go to the wiki page, where you can't post data, organized in tags, that makes easy for you to search for content
on the wiki. You can as well, delete the wiki, and leave, if you don't want to be a part of it anymore.

On the wiki page you can see the members of the wiki, and invite new people as well by hitting the invite button.
